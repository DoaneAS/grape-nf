Grape provides an extensive pipeline for RNA-Seq analyses. It allows the creation of an automated and integrated workflow to manage and analyse RNA-Seq data.

It uses {nextflow}[Nextflow^] as the execution backend and can be installed and run in a very simple way. Using Nextflow sharing features the pipeline is automatically downloaded from a git repository and run on the local environment. Please check {nextflow-docs}[Nextflow documentation^] for more information.
