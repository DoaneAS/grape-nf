TODO list
---------

- move to github
- add pipeline to CI server (circle)
- use single pipeline.db file
- integrate Kallisto, Sailfish and maybe other mappers
- add preprocessing steps for input (fastq) and references (genome, annotation)
- tune mapping steps for different quantification modes: only produce required bams
