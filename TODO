TODO list
---------

- fix issue with merge flag not being correctly set
- use pipeline.db file and write on it asynchronously to allow for `tail -f`
- move to github
- add pipeline to CI server (circle)
- integrate Kallisto, Sailfish and maybe other mappers
- add preprocessing steps for input (fastq) and references (genome, annotation)
- tune mapping steps for different quantification modes: only produce required bams
