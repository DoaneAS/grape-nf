# Things to do

* update RSEM version
* allow for custom arguments in tool templates
* more flexible tool configuration
* add `docker pull` command as `beforeScript` to config
* move to github
* add pipeline to CI server (circle)
* integrate Kallisto, Sailfish and maybe other mappers
* add preprocessing steps for input (fastq) and references (genome, annotation)
* tune mapping steps for different quantification modes: only produce required bams
